## Salesman

This is a new implementation of my master's degree, now I'm almost happy with it, so shimmer will no longer be under development

#### Installing the requirements

To install the requirements of this project is advisable to create a new virtual environment for it, to do this you can install `virtualenvwrapper` and run:

```sh
mkvirtualenv salesman # creates the virtual environment, it will automatically start using this environment
deactivate # top using the current environment
workon salesman # after created, you must run this to start using this environment
```

After creating your environment run the following command using the file `requirements.txt` available on the app directory of this project:

```sh
pip install -r app/requirements.txt
```
